    "reslutContent": "Flying fox species vary in body weight, ranging from 120–1,600 g (0.26–3.53 lb). Across all species, males are usually larger than females. The large flying fox has the longest forearm length and reported wingspan of any bat species, but some bat species exceed it in weight. Its wingspan is up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in), and it can weigh up to 1.1 kg (2+1⁄2 lb). The Indian and great flying foxes are heavier, at 1.6 and 1.45 kg (3+1⁄2 and 3+1⁄4 lb), respectively. Outside this genus, the giant golden-crowned flying fox (genus Acerodon) is the only bat with similar dimensions",

    "legendH1_1": "The presence of bats in legends and cultures",
    "legendP1_1": "Although only three species of bat (out of more than 1,300 species) drink blood, bats are often associated with Dracula. In Greek mythology, bats are associated with the underworld- Persephone and Hades. The bat is a god of death in Mayan culture.",
    "legendP1_2": "The Egyptians used a bat to signify a man of small means and weak power. Batman chose his costume to inspire fear in enemies, and this was also one of the inspirations for the use of bats in heraldry, such as in France, England, Spain, Switzerland, and Ireland. On coats of arms bats are usually displayed with wings open and facing the observer. Other traits bats are supposed to represent in heraldry include watchfulness, wakefulness, and vigilance.",
    "legendP1_3": "Some cultures view bats differently from the traditional western stance. Gypsies consider bats good luck, and the ancient kingdom of Macedonia thought bats the luckiest of all animals. Due to their longevity bats are sometimes associated with wisdom. In the Chinese language the word for bat is fu, which also is the name of the character meaning ‘happiness’. The figure of a bat stands for happiness or good luck and is frequently seen worked into designs in Chinese handicraft. Two bats written upon a gift signify good wishes from the donor, and a talisman widely used in China consists of a disk about the size of a dollar, enclosing the symbol of life (a tree with roots and branches), and surrounded by five bats with spread wings, facing in.",

    "legendP3_1": "The name 'Nosferatu' has been presented as an archaic Romanian word,[citation needed] synonymous with 'vampire'. However, it was largely popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Western fiction such as Dracula (1897), and the film Nosferatu (1922). One of the suggested etymologies of the term is that it is derived from the Romanian Nesuferit ('offensive' or 'troublesome').",
    "legendP3_2": "The etymological origins of the word nosferatu are difficult to determine. There is no doubt that it achieved currency through Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula and its unauthorised cinematic adaptation, Nosferatu (1922). Stoker identified his source for the term as 19th-century British author and speaker Emily Gerard. It is commonly thought that Gerard introduced the word into print in an 1885 magazine article, 'Transylvanian Superstitions',[1] and in her travelogue The Land Beyond the Forest[2] ('Transylvania' is Latin for 'beyond the forest', literally 'across/through the forest'). She merely refers to it as the Romanian word for vampire:",
    "legendP3_3": "More decidedly evil, however, is the vampire, or nosferatu, in which every Romanian peasant believes as firmly as he does in heaven or hell. There are two sorts of vampires-—living and dead. The living vampire is in general the illegitimate offspring of two illegitimate persons, but even a flawless pedigree will not ensure anyone against the intrusion of a vampire into his family vault, since every person killed by a nosferatu becomes likewise a vampire after death, and will continue to suck the blood of other innocent people till the spirit has been exorcised, either by opening the grave of the person suspected and driving a stake through the corpse, or firing a pistol shot into the coffin. In very obstinate cases it is further recommended to cut off the head and replace it in the coffin with the mouth filled with garlic, or to extract the heart and burn it, strewing the ashes over the grave.",
